                      http://www.syncleus.com/dannProject

These are the instructions for compiling, testing, and using the dANN core
library. If you've downloaded the binary distribution, skip to the "Using the
Library" portion of this document.


Description:

dANN is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Artificial Intelligence suite
intending to incorporate conventional techniques as well as entirely new
techniques inspired by biological systems. Some of the features included are:

 * Hyperassociative Map
 * 3D mapping and visualizations
 * Genetic Algorithms
 * Genetic Programming
 * Wavelet Genetics
 * ANN Connection Optimization
 * ANN Genetic Framework
 * Backprop ANN
 * Perceptron ANN
 * Layered Feedforward ANN
 * Fully/partial Feedback ANN
 * Example Applications


Getting The Files:

There are several distributions available: you can export from svn, download
the source, or download the precompiled jar files. If you would like to export
the latest version from svn to the current directory the command is:

svn export svn://svn.syncleus.com/dANN/trunk/projects/java_dann/

If you would like to obtain one of the latest versioned distributions simply get
one of the files found at:

http://files.syncleus.com/pub/dANN/latest/

If You would like an older version or snapshot you can go directly to:

http://files.syncleus.com/pub/dANN/


Compilation:

Assuming you obtained a source distribution in the previous step you will need
to continue with this step, otherwise skip ahead to "Using the Library".

First we need to compile the core library; change directory to the java_dann
directory where the build.xml file resides. Next run the following command:

ant build-all

If you are developing and would like to display lint4j based warnings execute
the following command:

ant lint

You should now have the appropriate jar files in build/jar.


Running Unit Tests:

The following step is only helpful if you are developing against the library
or have recently had trouble running the library reliably and wish to submit
unit tests along with your bug report. In order to execute the packaged unit
tests simply execute the following command from within the java_dann directory:

ant tests-nocoverage

If all goes well it should execute all unit tests with no errors or failures.
Once the tests are completed the detailed XML reports can be found in
build/tests.


Generating Javadocs:

The following step is only useful if you plan to develop with the library;
if you are only running the library as a dependency for another application
you shouldn't need the javadoc API documentation. In order to generate the
javadocs from the source code simply execute the following from within
the java_dann directory:

ant javadoc


Using the Library:

In order to use the library you either need to have obtained the binary
distribution or used the source distribution and successfully completed the
"Compilation" step above. Once compiled the core library will reside in the
following location:

build/jar/dann.jar

You will want to use this jar file in the classpath of the application that
uses this library (follow the directions for that application). You will need
to compile and run it against java 1.5 or later (unless the application
requires a later version). You will also need to add the following libraries
to the application's classpath, these libraries should be included in lib:

lib/j3dcore.jar
lib/vecmath.jar
lib/j3dutils.jar

You may not need all these libraries for every application so consult your
target applications documentation for more details.

If you intend to run any of the 3D visualizations then you will need to have
Java3D installed during runtime. You do not, however, need Java3D installed
to compile. You can obtain Java3D at the following URL:
